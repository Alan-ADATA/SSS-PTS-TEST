Block Storage Benchmark

This benchmark suite uses fio, scripts for automation and graph/PDF 
generators for reporting to replicate the SNIA Solid State Storage 
(SSS) Performance Test Specification (PTS) Enterprise v1.1. This specification
includes 8 test each measuring different block storage performance 
characteristics. The specification is available here:

http://snia.org/sites/default/files/SSS_PTS_Enterprise_v1.1.pdf

A few notes on cloud/virtualization limitations as they pertain to SNIA test 
specifications:

1. Due to virtualization, direct access to hardware commands like ATA secure 
   erase are generally unavailable in cloud environments. Thus, the recommended  
   Purge methods prescribed by the test specification are generally not 
   feasible in a cloud environment. As a workaround, where supported, full 
   device TRIM is applied prior to preconditioning and testing cycles (using 
   `blkdiscard` for devices and `fstrim` for mounted volumes). If ATA secure 
   erase and TRIM are not supported, devices are zero filled as a last resort. 
   The purge method used is documented in test output. If test targets are 
   rotational devices, zero fill formatting is used instead. Thus, the purge 
   order of precedence is: 1) ATA secure erase; 2) TRIM (SSD only) 3) zero 
   fill. These can be overridden using the nosecureerase, notrim and nozerofill
   test parameters.
2. The test specification requirement for write caches to be disabled cannot 
   be guaranteed in a cloud environment.
3. Often virtual machine block storage devices are partial logical volumes
   on a physical drive that may contain additional logical volumes in use by 
   other users. Because of this, testing may not be across the full LBA of  
   the physical drive (i.e. ActiveRange < 100%). Additionally, the possible  
   shared state of the physical drive may contribute to higher variability
   and difficulty or inability to achieve the prescribed +/-10% condition for 
   Steady State verification. This may also restrict the ability to 
   consistently reproduce results across multiple tests


TESTING PARAMETERS
The SNIA test specification allow for some user configurable parameters. These 
are described below. To start testing, use `run.php`. For runtime options, use 
`run.php --help`. Each of the parameters below may be specified using CLI 
arguments (e.g. `run.php --test=iops`) or `bm_param_` prefixed environment 
variables (e.g. `export bm_param_test=iops`)

* active_range              LBA range to use for testing represented as a 
                            percentage. Default is 100, or 100% per the SNIA
                            test specification. To test across a smaller 
                            range, this parameter may be reduced. If the
                            test targets are not devices, test size is total 
                            free space - 100 MB. WARNING: if multiple volume
                            type targets are specified, active range will be 
                            limited to the least amount of free space on all 
                            targets
                            
* fio                       Optional explicit path to the fio command - 
                            otherwise fio in PATH will be used
                            
* fio_*                     Optional fio runtime parameters. By default, fio 
                            parameters are generated by the test script per 
                            the SNIA test specification. Use this parameter to 
                            override default fio settings 
                            (e.g. fio_ioengine=sync)
                            
* font_size                 The base font size pt to use in reports and graphs. 
                            All text will be relative to this size (i.e. 
                            smaller, larger). Default is 9. Graphs use this 
                            value + 4 (i.e. default 13). Open Sans is included
                            with this software. To change this, simply replace
                            the reports/font.ttf file with your desired font
                            
* highcharts_js_url         URL to highcharts.js. Highcharts is used to render
                            3D charts in reports. Use 'no3dcharts' to disable 
                            3D charts. Default for this parameter is
                            http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js
                            
* highcharts3d_js_url       URL to highcharts-3d.js. Highcharts is used to 
                            render 3D charts in reports. Use 'no3dcharts' to 
                            disable 3D charts. Default for this parameter is
                            http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts-3d.js
                            
* jquery_url                URL for jquery. jquery is used by Highcharts.
                            Highcharts is used to render 3D charts in reports. 
                            Use 'no3dcharts' to disable 3D charts. Default for 
                            this parameter is
                            http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js

* meta_instance_id          The compute service instance type this test pertains 
                            to (e.g. c3.xlarge). Used for report headers
                            
* meta_memory               Memory descriptor to use for report headers. If not 
                            specified, the amount of memory will be used (as 
                            reported by 'free')
                            
* meta_notes_storage        Optional notes to display in the Storage Platform 
                            header column

* meta_os_info              Operating system descriptor to use for report 
                            headers. If not specified, this meta data will be 
                            derived from the first line of /etc/issue
                            
* meta_provider             The name of the cloud provider this test pertains
                            to. Used for report headers. May also be specified 
                            using the environment variable bm_provider

* meta_region               The compute service region this test pertains to. 
                            Used for report headers. May also be specified 
                            using the environment variable bm_region
                            
* meta_storage_config       Storage configuration descriptor to use for report 
                            headers. If not specified, 'Unknown' will be 
                            displayed in this column
                            
* meta_storage_vol_info     If testing is against a volume, this optioanl 
                            parameter may be used to designate setup of that 
                            volume (e.g. Raid, File System, etc.). Only 
                            displayed when targets are volumes. If this
                            parameter is not specified the file system type 
                            for each target volume will be included in this 
                            column

                            If not specified, this header column will be blank
                            
* meta_test_sw              Name/version of the test software. Used for report 
                            headers. If not specified, this header column will 
                            be blank
                            
* no3dcharts                Don't generate 3D charts. Unlike 2D charts rendered 
                            with the free chart utility gnuplot, 3D charts are 
                            rendered using highcharts - a commercial javascript
                            charting tool. highcharts is available for free for 
                            non-commercial and development use, and for a 
                            nominal fee otherwise. See http://www.highcharts.com
                            for additional licensing information
                            
* nojson                    Don't generate JSON fio output archive
                            
* nopdfreport               Don't generate PDF version of test report - 
                            report.pdf. (wkhtmltopdf dependency removed if 
                            specified)
                            
* noprecondition            Don't perform the default 2X 128K sequential 
                            workload independent preconditioning (per the SNIA 
                            test specification). This step precedes workload 
                            dependent preconditioning
                            
* nopurge                   Don't require a purge for testing. If this 
                            parameter is not set, and at least 1 target could 
                            not be purged, testing will abort. This parameter
                            is implicit if --nosecureerase, --notrim and 
                            --nozerofill are all specified
                            
* norandom                  Don't test using random (less compressible) data.
                            Use of random data for IO is a requirement of the 
                            SNIA test specification
                            
* noreport                  Don't generate html or PDF test reports - 
                            report.zip and report.pdf (gnuplot, wkhtmltopdf and
                            zip dependencies removed if specified)
                            
* nosecureerase             Don't attempt to secure erase device targets prior 
                            to test cycles (this is the first choice - hdparm 
                            dependency removed if specified). This parameter is
                            implicit if --secureerase_pswd is not provided
                            
* notrim                    Don't attempt to TRIM devices/volumes prior to 
                            testing cycles (util-linux dependency removed if 
                            specified)
                            
* nozerofill                Don't zero fill rotational devices (or SSD devices 
                            when TRIM is not supported) prior to testing 
                            cycles. Zero fill applies only to device targets
                            

* oio_per_thread            The outstanding IO per thread (a.k.a. queue depth). 
                            This translates to the fio `iodepth` parameter. 
                            Total outstanding IO for a given test is 
                            `threads` * `threads_oio`. Per the SNIA test 
                            specification, this is a user definable parameter. 
                            For latency tests, this parameter is a fixed value
                            of 1. Default value for this parameter is 16
                            
* output                    The output directory to use for writing test artifacts 
                            (JSON and reports). If not specified, the current 
                            working directory will be used
                            
* precondition_passes       Number of passes for workload independent 
                            preconditioning. Per the SNIA test specification 
                            the default is 2X. Use this or the --noprecondition
                            argument to change this default behavior
                            
* secureerase_pswd          In order for ATA secure erase to be attempted for 
                            device purge (prior to test invocation), you must
                            first set a security password using the command:
                            sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass [pswd] /dev/[device]
                            The password used should be supplied using this 
                            test parameter. If it is not supplied, ATA secure
                            erase will not be attempted. If this parameter is 
                            not specified, the hdparm dependent will be removed
                            
* skip_blocksize            block sizes to skip during testing. This argument 
                            may be repeated. Valid options are:
                            1m, 128k, 64k, 32k, 16k, 8k, 512b
                            
* skip_workload             workloads to skip during testing. This argument may
                            be repeated. Valid options are:
                            100/0, 95/5, 65/35, 50/50, 35/65, 5/95
                            
* ss_rounds                 The maximum number of test cycle iterations to 
                            allow for steady state verification. Default is 
                            x=25 (per the SNIA test specification). If steady 
                            state cannot be reached within this number of test 
                            cycles (per the ss_verification ratio), testing 
                            will terminate, and results will be designated as 
                            having not achieved steady state. This parameter 
                            may be used to increase (or decrease) the number of 
                            test cycles. A minimum value of 5 is permitted 
                            (the minimum number of cycles for the measurement 
                            window)
                            
* ss_verification           Ratio to utilize for steady state verification. The 
                            default is 10 or 10% per the SNIA test 
                            specification. In order to achieve steady state 
                            verification, the variance between the current test 
                            cycle loop and the 4 that precede it cannot exceed 
                            this value. In cloud environments with high IO 
                            variability, it may be difficult to achieve the 
                            default ratio and thus this value may be increased 
                            using this parameter
                            
* target                    REQUIRED: The target device or volume to use for 
                            testing. This parameter may reference either the 
                            physical device (e.g. /dev/sdc) or a mounted volume
                            (e.g. /ssd). TRIM will be attempted using 
                            `blkdiscard` for a device and `fstrim` for a volume
                            if the targets are non-rotational. For rotational 
                            devices, a zero fill will be used (i.e.

                            specified each separated by a comma. When multiple 
                            targets are specified, the `threads` parameter 
                            represents the number of threads per target (i.e. 
                            total threads = # of targets * `threads`). Multiple 
                            target tests provide aggregate metrics. With the 
                            exception of latency tests, if multiple targets are 
                            specified, they will be tested concurrently. 
                            Sufficient permissions for the device/volume must 
                            exist for the user that initiates testing.

                            Multiple tests may be specified each separated by 
                            a comma. Default for this parameter is iops. Some 
                            tests like 'hir' are specific to SSD type devices
                            
* threads                   The number of threads to use for the test cycle. 
                            Per the SNIA test specification, this is a user 
                            definable parameter. The default value for this 
                            parameter is the number of CPU cores. This 
                            parameter may contain the token {cpus} which will 
                            be replaced with the number of CPU cores present. 
                            It may also contain a mathematical expression in 
                            conjunction with {cpus} - e.g. {cpus}/2. If 
                            `target` references multiple devices or volumes, 
                            this parameter signifies the number of threads per 
                            device. Thus total threads is # of targets * 
                            `threads`. Latency tests are fixed at 1 thread. 
                            This parameter is used to define the fio --numjobs
                            argument
                            
* threads_per_target_max    The maximum number of threads per target - default
                            is 4
                            
* timeout                   Max time to permit for testing in seconds. Default 
                            is 24 hours (86400 seconds)
                            
* verbose                   Show verbose output - warning: this may produce a 
                            lot of output
                            
* wd_test_duration          The test duration for workload dependent test 
                            iterations in seconds. Default is 60 per the SNIA 
                            test specification

TEST ARTIFACTS
Upon successful completion of testing, the following artifacts will be 
produced in the working directory ([test] replaced with one of the test 
identifiers - e.g. report-iops.json):

  fio-[test].json    JSON formatted fio job results for [test]. Jobs are 
                     in run order each with a unique job name. For workload 
                     independent preconditioning, the job name uses the 
                     format 'wipc-N', where N is the preconditioning pass
                     (i.e. N=1 is first pass, N=2 second). Unless 
                     --precondition_passes is otherwise specified, only 2 wipc 
                     JSON files should be present (each representing one of the 
                     2X preconditioning tests). For workload dependent 
                     preconditioning and other testing, the job name is set by
                     the test. For example, for the IOPS test, the job name 
                     format is 'xN-[rw]-[bs]-rand', where N is iteration 
                     number (1-25+), [rw] is the read/write ratio (separated by 
                     underscore) and [bs] is block size. Jobs that fall within
                     the steady state measurement window will have the suffix 
                     '-ssmw' (e.g. x5-0_100-4k-rand-ssmw). there may be up to 
                     10 fio-[test].json corresponding with each of the tests 
                     and 2 files for throughput: test-throughput-128k.json and
                     test-throughput-1024k.json
  report.zip         HTML test report (open index.html). The report design
                     and layout is based on the SNIA test specification. In 
                     addition, this archive contains source gnuplot scripts and 
                     data files for report graphs. Graphs are rendered in svg 
                     format
  report.pdf         PDF version of the test report (wkhtmltopdf used to 
                     generate this version of the report)
